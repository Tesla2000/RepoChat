## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to parse arguments based on the Config class, create a configuration instance with the parsed arguments, and print the configuration.

**parameters**:
- No explicit parameters are passed directly to the main function. The parameters are implicitly used within the function.

**Code Description**:
The main function first calls the parse_arguments function with the Config class to obtain parsed arguments. It then utilizes these arguments to create a configuration instance by calling the create_config_with_args function with the Config class and the parsed arguments. Finally, the function prints the created configuration instance.

The main function serves as the entry point for configuring and initializing the application settings based on the provided configuration class. By sequentially calling the parse_arguments and create_config_with_args functions, the main function orchestrates the setup of the configuration instance and displays it for further usage within the application.

**Note**:
Developers using the main function should ensure that the Config class is correctly defined and imported to enable the parsing and creation of configuration instances. The main function provides a structured approach to handling configuration setup and can be extended to incorporate additional functionalities or actions based on the parsed configuration.
