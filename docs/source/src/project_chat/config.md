## ClassDef Config
**Config**: The function of Config is to define a configuration class that inherits from the BaseModel class and sets the _root attribute to the parent directory of the current file.

**attributes**:
- _root: Path = Path(__file__).parent

**Code Description**: The Config class is a subclass of the BaseModel class. It initializes the _root attribute with the parent directory of the current file. This attribute can be used to store the path to the configuration file or directory.

The Config class plays a crucial role in defining the configuration structure for the application. By inheriting from the BaseModel class, it inherits functionalities related to data modeling. The _root attribute, initialized with the parent directory of the current file, provides a starting point for defining paths or locations within the configuration.

In the project, the Config class is utilized by the main function in the main.py file. The main function parses arguments based on the Config class, creates a configuration instance using the parsed arguments, and prints the resulting configuration. This demonstrates the Config class's role in setting up and managing application configurations.

**Note**: Developers should ensure that the Config class is correctly defined and imported when working with configuration settings. The _root attribute can be leveraged to establish paths within the configuration. The interaction between the Config class and the main function showcases how configuration setup can be orchestrated and utilized within the application.
## FunctionDef parse_arguments(config_class)
**parse_arguments**: The function of parse_arguments is to parse arguments based on the provided configuration class and return the parsed arguments.

**parameters**:
- config_class: Type[Config] - The configuration class used to define the structure of the arguments.

**Code Description**:
The parse_arguments function takes a configuration class as input and creates a CustomArgumentParser instance. It then iterates over the model fields of the configuration class, excluding those starting with '_', and adds arguments to the parser based on the field names, types, defaults, and help messages. Finally, the function parses the arguments and returns the result.

This function plays a crucial role in handling argument parsing for configuration settings within the application. By dynamically adding arguments based on the configuration class attributes, it provides a flexible and structured approach to defining and processing command-line arguments.

In the project, the parse_arguments function is called within the main function in the main.py file. By passing the Config class to parse_arguments, the main function obtains parsed arguments that are used to create a configuration instance. This demonstrates the integration of argument parsing functionality with the configuration setup process in the application.

**Note**:
Developers utilizing the parse_arguments function should ensure that the provided configuration class defines the necessary model fields for argument parsing. It is essential to follow a consistent naming convention for model fields to align with the expected command-line argument format.

**Output Example**:
An example output of the parse_arguments function would be a Namespace object containing the parsed arguments ready for further processing within the application.
## FunctionDef create_config_with_args(config_class, args)
**create_config_with_args**: The function of create_config_with_args is to instantiate a configuration object based on the provided configuration class and arguments, ensuring the existence of specified paths within the configuration.

**parameters**:
- config_class: Type[Config] - The configuration class used to create the configuration object.
- args - The arguments used to populate the configuration object.

**Code Description**:
The create_config_with_args function takes a configuration class and arguments as input. It creates a new instance of the configuration class by populating the instance attributes with values from the provided arguments. Additionally, it checks for specific attributes within the configuration object that represent paths. If a path attribute is identified and does not exist, the function creates the path.

The function iterates over the model fields of the configuration class to set the corresponding values from the arguments. It then checks each attribute to determine if it represents a Path, ensuring that the path exists by creating it if it does not.

The utilization of this function ensures that a properly configured instance of the specified configuration class is created, with necessary paths initialized for further application usage.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the configuration class and arguments are correctly provided to the create_config_with_args function to instantiate the configuration object successfully. It is essential to define the configuration class with appropriate model fields representing paths that might need to be created during configuration instantiation.

**Output Example**:
```
Config(_root=PosixPath('/path/to/root'))
```
